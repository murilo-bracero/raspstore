# RASPSTORAGE

##  ⚠️ [DISCLAIMER] ⚠️

This is a personal project of mine and is also still in-development, so feel free to suggest editions, open issues or make PRs.

At this moment, raspstore requires an external IDP to manage users, like keycloak or firebase authenticator.

## DESCRIPTION

Rasptorage is a storage application designed for personal private clouds (e.g. Home Servers).

It is built to require minimal maintenance and configuration, ensuring a simple "install-and-use" experience.

Rasptorage features a built-in UI for convenient file upload and download operations. Additionally, it allows users to manage storage settings, both on an individual user level and for the entire server.
